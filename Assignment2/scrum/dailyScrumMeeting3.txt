	Yesterday : Did nothing
	Today     : Made branches and updated members.txt
	Obstacles : Learning how to make branches

Oct 24, 2017
	Yesterday : Made branches and updated members.txt
	Today     : Held a scrum meeting to assign user story tasks
	Obstacles : Learning how to push branches to the cloud  from command line

Oct 25, 2017
	Yesterday : Made branches
	Today     : Took a break to work on other assignments
	Obstacles : Since no work was done, there were no obstacles

Oct 26, 2017
	Yesterday : Took a break
	Today     : We had a scrum meeting to discuss the structure of the GUI. I fixed
				the circle drawing bug so it draws in the correct location. I also
				added the feature that the circle gets updated on the screen when the
				mouse moves.
	Obstacles : It took some time to find all the places in the code where circles
				were hooked to the GUI.

Oct 27, 2017
	Yesterday : I fixed all circle related user stories.
	Today     : I took a break to do other course related stuff.
	Obstacles : No obstacles since I didn't do anything.

Oct 28, 2017
	Yesterday : I did nothing.
	Today     : I did nothing in order to do work in other classes. 
	Obstacles : No obstacles since I didn't do anything.

	Yesterday : I did nothing.
	Today     : I did nothing in order to do work in other classes.

Oct 30, 2017
	Yesterday : I did nothing.
	Today     : I did nothing in order to do work in other classes.
	Obstacles : No obstacles since I didn't do anything.

Oct 31, 2017
	Yesterday : I did nothing.
	Today     : I added some ideas on possible architecture that can be
				integrated into the design. 
	Obstacles : Learning how the different design patterns worked since
				it was my first time seeing them.

Nov 1, 2017
	Yesterday : I worked on architecture.
	Today     : I did nothing.
	Obstacles : No obstacles since I didn't do anything.
	
Nov 2, 2017
	Yesterday : I did nothing.
	Today     : We had a scrum meeting to discuss how a change in architecture
				would affect the whole model. I also helped with the implementation
				of the square user story.
	Obstacles : It took some time trying to implement drawing squares in the simplest
				way possible.
	
Nov 3, 2017
	Yesterday : We held a scrum meeting about architecture and I helped with square.
	Today     : I did nothing.
	Obstacles : No obstacles since I didn't do anything.

Nov 4, 2017
	Yesterday : I did nothing.
	Today     : I added some more ideas about architecture.
	Obstacles : I had some trouble visualizing how the code would work with new
				architecture because our team is not implementing this yet.

Nov 5, 2017
	Yesterday : I added some more architecture ideas.
	Today     : I helped to make the GUI look better. I also implemented the
				scrub eraser user story.
	Obstacles : I had to add more if statements to all mouse events which took
				some time.

Nov 6, 2017
	Yesterday : I improved the look of the GUI and added a scrub eraser.
	Today     : I did nothing in order to do work in other classes.
	Obstacles : No obstacles since I didn't do anything.
	
Nov 7, 2017
	Yesterday : I did nothing.
	Today     : I added some more ideas about architecture.
	Obstacles : No obstacles since I didn't do anything.
	
Nov 8, 2017
	Yesterday : I added some more ideas about architecture.
	Today     : I did nothing in order to do work in other classes.
	Obstacles : Trying to understand how all the design patterns interact
				with each other.
	
Nov 9, 2017
	Yesterday : I did nothing.
	Today     : We had a scrum meeting to discuss implementing the new
				architecture. I also created the factory for handling
				the correct strategy selection and created all the strategy
				classes.
	Obstacles : We had to figure out how to work on completing user
				stories in a way that would reduce git merge conflicts. We
				also had to plan out the entire design beforehand in order
				to ensure we had all the necessary classes
	
Nov 10, 2017
	Yesterday : I created the factory and strategy classes.
	Today     : I did nothing.
	Obstacles : No obstacles since I didn't do anything.
	
Nov 11, 2017
	Yesterday : I did nothing.
	Today     : I did nothing in order to do work in other classes.
	Obstacles : No obstacles since I didn't do anything.
	
Nov 12, 2017
	Yesterday : I did nothing.
	Today     : I added some ideas about architecture, especially undo and redo.
	Obstacles : I had to visualize how undo and redo would work by testing it
				out in Paint first. Then, I had to try to replicate that concept
				using the designs we learned.
	
Nov 13, 2017
	Yesterday : I added architecture ideas about undo and redo.
	Today     : I implemented undo and redo. Also, I contributed to fixing the
				strategies and commands to work as intended.
	Obstacles : I had to create and modify a lot of classes.
	
Nov 14, 2017
	Yesterday : I implemented undo and redo.
	Today     : I worked on polyline, triangle and oval related classes. Also, I
				implemented movable shapes.
	Obstacles : I encountered a lot of merge conflicts due to the team pushing code
				on the same files I was working on. This took a while to resolve.
