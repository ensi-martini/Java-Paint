Nov 2, 2017
	Yesterday : Architechture.
	Today     : Made buttons have images instead of words.
	Obstacles : Buttons were resizing to the image size, instead of the other way around, so we have large unsightly buttons that were very counter-intuitive. Also had an issue with passing the actionevents on properly because they no longer had text within them.

	Yesterday : Button images.
	Today     : Fixed button size, implemented color picker.
	Obstacles : Many unnecessary color options in panes, also had to figure out how to pass color info within the current architechture.
